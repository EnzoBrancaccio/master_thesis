Notes on special solvers (slr_papers numbers):

7) SMV
SMV Model Checker to verify CSPs

9) CBMC
a SAT-based source code bounded model checker for C
E. Clarke, D. Kroening, and F. Lerda. A tool for checking ANSI-C programs. In TACAS, volume 2988 of LNCS, pages 168–176. Springer, 2004

25) clp(FD)
library module for SICStus Prolog

36) Alloy Analyzer
Alcoa comes with a suite of public domain SAT solvers

41) Alloy Analyzer with MiniSat
Alloy Analyzer was configured to use MiniSat as a solver.

44) Pacogen
constraint solver

45) Alloy Analzyer, MiniSat
MiniSat only mentioned in Threats to Validity (p. 146)

50) Alloy Analyzer
and we can use it with different off-the-shelf SAT solvers.

51) SAT Solver
The Alloy module is analyzed using a SAT solver
After the transformation, the Alloy module is analyzed using the APIs of Alloy Analyzer

52) SPLOT tool
This information can be obtained using the feature model analyzer provided by the SPLOT tool

67) Alloy Analyzer
we use Alloy because it easily work with any different SAT solver, independently of a specific implementation.

77) AllSat, MiniSat
We have implemented an ALLSAT using the blocking algorithm ... by extending MiniSAT

81) SPASS
generalized first-order theorem prover

163) SAT Solver
which is then given to a SAT solver, e.g., as provided by the feature modeling tool FAMILIAR
Not explicitly saying they used the FAMILIAR SAT Solver

296) Plingeling
multi-threaded version of Lingeling using Pthreads

309) VSAT
variational solver in the Haskell programming language

331) SAT Solver
referring to slr_paper: 388 with Sat4J 2.2 and probSAT 
-> used for solver statistics but doesn't change that 331 didn't mention them

333) Uppaal
Our tool performs TA construction as well as static analysis and dynamic analysis with Uppaal automatically on the given input models.

376) randomized Sat4J
modified version from C. Henard, M. Papadakis, G. Perrouin, J. Klein, P. Heymans, and Y. Le Traon, “Bypassing the combinatorial explosion: Using similarity to generate and prioritize t-wise test configurations for software product lines,” IEEE Trans. Softw. Eng., vol. 40, no. 7, pp. 650–670, Jul. 2014.

For solver statistics, solver versions are ignored. This also affects
